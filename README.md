## Welcome to [Corona Warrior](https://corona-warrior.web.app)!
Corona Warrior is a 3D game. The landscape is a maze. The maze was built using GIMP to draw a heightmap maze. You play as a misunderstood escaped Alien trying to save the world from COVID-19 pandemic. Bad Corona Orbs are floating throughout the map. If your ship runs into them You will die and lose the game. You can shoot them with fireballs to destroy them. Along your journey you will discover Good Corona bottle caps that will give you extra points. The end of the game concludes when you find the hidden vaccine.

**Important Notes**
- Does not support **Mobile** or **Chrome** use.
- Character movement and shooting is not capital sensitive. Therefore caps can be on or off.
- Main Character shoots fireballs with **"B"** key.
- Main Character **only moves** with **"W"**, **"A"**, **"S"**, and **"D"** keyboard keys.
- Hard Refresh your browser to reduce rendering and collision bugs. Especially if replaying the game.

This project was built to learn 3D game design and programming. I used Blender to help work on the 3D models. Some assets (models, textures, etc) were acquired as free resources from 3D market places. Babylon.js and Cannon.js are at the core of this project.

The game is accessible at https://corona-warrior.web.app
